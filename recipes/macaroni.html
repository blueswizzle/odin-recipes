    <br>
    <p> <u>Ingredients</u> </p>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (8 ounce) box elbow macaroni</li>
        <li>1/4 cup butter</li>
        <li>1/4 cup all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>Ground black pepper for taste</li>
        <li>2 cups milk</li>
        <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar cheese</li>
    </ul>
    <p> <u>Directions</u> </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil.
            Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>While cooking the macaroni, melt butter in another saucepan over medium heat. 
            Add flour, salt, and pepper and stir until smooth, about 5 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>Pour in milk slowly to the melted butter and flour mix, while stirring continuously. 
            Continue to cook and stir until mixture is smooth and bubbling, about 5 minutes, making sure the milk doesn't burn.
        </li>
        <li>Add Cheddar cheese and stir until melted, 2 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <li>Drain macaroni and fold into cheese sauce until coated.</li>
        <li>All done. If you want, you can use more cheese instead of just 2 cups.</li>
    </ol>
